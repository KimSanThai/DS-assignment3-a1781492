Design Brief:

Implement Paxos algorithm implement to simulate the Adelaide Suburbs Council Election. Paxos implementation is based upon Paul Krzyanowski (https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/notes/paxos.html).
The implementation will use a decentralized design where messages are sent directly peer to peer. The major components for this code is the Acceptor and Proposer.

For Psuedo-Code refer to website above.
